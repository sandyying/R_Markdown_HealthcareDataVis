Notes

Focus on the top 3 DRGs (from Nathan's crosstab)
Focus on the 4 most expensive DRGs (from Nathan's boxplots)
Examine if the ratio of coverage is the same amongst all states for each DRG
Do other stuff (from all of the chapters) with each DRG to see if there's a pattern or not amongst coverage
(Does one state consistently cover more than the others?)
